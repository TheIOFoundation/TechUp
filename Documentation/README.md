{% endembed %}

## The Initiative

The IO Foundation (TIOF) is a global for-impact NGO born from a fundamental concern about the state of technology in the world and advocating for [Data-Centric Digital Rights](https://tiof.click/DCDRAdvocacy).

As societies become inevitably digital, _their architects and builders need to embrace their fundamental role as the_ [_Next Generation of Rights defenders_](https://tiof.click/TIOFNextGen).

There remains, however, a limited international understanding of the true impact of technology on citizens and their digital twins as data becomes an increasingly powerful economic, political and social force.

TIOF aims to raise awareness of the importance of [Data-Centric Digital Rights](https://tiof.click/DCDRAdvocacy) in collaboration with stakeholders ranging from civil society, programmer communities, bodies of governance and corporate and work together to achieve the proclamation and adoption of a [Universal Declaration of Digital Rights](https://tiof.click/UDDRWeb).

The IO Foundation advances its [Data-Centric Digital Rights advocacy](https://tiof.click/DCDRAdvocacy) through the implementation of a number of [initiatives](broken-reference).

### Mission

> To promote, protect and provide solutions for Data-Centric Digital Rights.

### Vision

> A world where Human Rights and Data-Centric Digital Rights are one and the same.



### Values

The IO Foundation delivers its mission through the observance of the following values:

> **Community:** Data-Centric Digital Rights is a global endeavor that requires the active participation of everyone, from policy makers to citizens, businesses and the people who will architect and build our digital societies.

> **Accountability:** We recognize the critical importance of operating under procedures and methodologies that are transparent in order to generate the necessary trust in the organization, our [DCDR Principles](https://tiof.click/DCDRPrinciples) and the advocacy at large.

> **Impact:** Our initiatives are designed and implemented only to serve the broader advocacy and to help, step by step, generate practical outcomes that make technology better and safer transparently for citizens.
