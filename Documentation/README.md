### The Problem

Devs need to get involved



Why is it happening:&#x20;

* No language
* No training on how to be that leader

The IO Foundation works on these 3 problems with

DCDR > Languge

TechUp > Being that leader

Crowdshape > Giving them the tools





### Value Proposition

Project Lockdown adopts the following 2 core approaches to deliver its value proposition:

* Data collected strictly from official sources Project Lockdown identifies official source documents that are originated by governments with the objective of only delivering data that has legal merit.

Disclaimer: For a number of reasons, some of the current data on the COVID-19 NPIs dataset later was obtained from other sources. This situation is being resolved.

* Rights-based core data points All core data points are devised based on their potential impact on a clearly defined Human or Digital Right. This unique approach provides insight over the impact of government policies in citizens' Rights.
* Global Rights Index Combining official data and Rights-based data points enables Project Lockdown

Disclaimer: The Global Rights Index is a current Goal for Project Lockdown (and thus a Work In Progress)

### The Solution





[TechUp](https://theiofoundation.org/TechUp) offers free capacity-building sessions to anyone interested to learn new skills and support rights-based digital societies.

Focusing on civic tech, TechUp by The IO Foundation aims to build an empowered community spanning various sectors, from tech professionals and corporations to students and volunteers who we hope to serve as advocates of digital rights.

In one packed weekend, there is much to learn and take away from TechUpâ€™s monthly events.

For anyone who signs up, TechUp presents opportunities for learning, growth and collaboration with professionals from around the world who are doing amazing work in their respective fields. Register for our monthly event [here](https://tiof.click/EventsRSVP).

### **Code of Conduct**

To ensure a conducive and respectful environment, TehUp and its community are guided by The IO Foundationâ€™s Code of Conduct.

We encourage you to read it (and copy it if you find it useful!). For any doubts donâ€™t hesitate to find us on the Event Support table at the Lounge.
