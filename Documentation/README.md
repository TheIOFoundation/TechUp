## The Initiative

The IO Foundation (TIOF) is a global for-impact NGO born from a fundamental concern about the state of technology in the world and advocating for [Data-Centric Digital Rights](https://tiof.click/DCDRAdvocacy).

As societies become inevitably digital, _their architects and builders need to embrace their fundamental role as the_ [_Next Generation of Rights defenders_](https://tiof.click/TIOFNextGen).

There remains, however, a limited international understanding of the true impact of technology on citizens and their digital twins as data becomes an increasingly powerful economic, political and social force.

TIOF aims to raise awareness of the importance of [Data-Centric Digital Rights](https://tiof.click/DCDRAdvocacy) in collaboration with stakeholders ranging from civil society, programmer communities, bodies of governance and corporate and work together to achieve the proclamation and adoption of a [Universal Declaration of Digital Rights](https://tiof.click/UDDRWeb).

The IO Foundation advances its [Data-Centric Digital Rights advocacy](https://tiof.click/DCDRAdvocacy) through the implementation of a number of [initiatives](broken-reference).

### Mission

> To promote, protect and provide solutions for Data-Centric Digital Rights.

### Vision

> A world where Human Rights and Data-Centric Digital Rights are one and the same.



### Values

The IO Foundation delivers its mission through the observance of the following values:

> **Community:** Data-Centric Digital Rights is a global endeavor that requires the active participation of everyone, from policy makers to citizens, businesses and the people who will architect and build our digital societies.

> **Accountability:** We recognize the critical importance of operating under procedures and methodologies that are transparent in order to generate the necessary trust in the organization, our [DCDR Principles](https://tiof.click/DCDRPrinciples) and the advocacy at large.

> **Impact:** Our initiatives are designed and implemented only to serve the broader advocacy and to help, step by step, generate practical outcomes that make technology better and safer transparently for citizens.

Introduction to the DCDR Advocacy initiative
{% endembed %}

## The Initiative

Data-Centric Digital Rights (DCDR), an initiative from [The IO Foundation](https://tiof.click/TIOFWeb), is the advocacy by which it aims at protecting citizens' Rights by transparently implementing in their daily technology the regulations that should protect them.

TIOF views the technology as currently non-correlated with all working understandings and practices as to how any public-consumption industry functions traditionally where a clear separation is made between:

* Experts, who understand the complexities to design and build products that are compliant with applicable legislation and
* Citizens, who are solely tasked for being responsible users of the product

{% hint style="info" %}
As core stakeholders, technologists play a critical role as the [Next Generation of Rights Defenders](https://tiof.click/TIOFNextGen) and need to orient themselves through new design and implementation paradigms focused on protecting data. The [DCDR Principles](https://tiof.click/DCDRPrinciples) put forward by The IO Foundation are concepts that help them navigate the intricacies of applying Human and Digital Rights in digital infrastructures, products and services.
{% endhint %}

In essence, DCDR is a framework for technologists composed by Principles, Taxonomies and other technical tools. It enables them to develop a deeper understanding about the nature of data, the digital twins that emerge from it and make possible for them to embrace their role as [NextGen Rights Defenders](https://tiof.click/TIOFNextGen).

{% hint style="success" %}
By understanding that [_we are our data_](https://tiof.click/DCDRPrinciple1), technologists may architect Digital Spaces that aim at [_ending remedy_](https://tiof.click/DCDRPrinciple2) and build it so that they implement [_Rights by design_](https://tiof.click/DCDRPrinciple3).
{% endhint %}

### Objectives

The DCDR initiative aims at encourage a shift in the current technology paradigms by providing

* [DCDR Principles](https://tiof.click/DCDRPrinciples)
* [Sagan Oath](https://tiof.click/DCDRSaganOath)
* Generating the necessary body of work for
  * A [DCDR framework](https://tiof.click/DCDRFramework)
  * A set of taxonomies for
    * [Digital Harms](https://tiof.click/DCDRDigitalHarms)
    * [Digital Rights](https://tiof.click/DCDRDigitalRights)
    * [Use Cases](https://tiof.click/DCDRUseCases)

## Mission & Vision

While the DCDR initiative is designed in order to support TIOF's [mission](https://tiof.click/TIOFMission) and to achieve its [vision](https://tiof.click/TIOFVision), it nonetheless also formulates its own Mission & Vision.

### Mission

> To provide technologist with a clear framework and taxonomies to embed Data-Centric Digital Rights into technology and enable their role as Next Generation of Rights Defenders.

### Vision

> A world where technology protects digital citizens and their digital twins transparently and by design.

## Values

The DCDR initiative adheres to the same [values](https://tiof.click/TIOFValues) as The IO Foundation to delivers its mission.

### The Problem

Devs need to get involved



Why is it happening:&#x20;

* No language
* No training on how to be that leader

The IO Foundation works on these 3 problems with

DCDR > Languge

TechUp > Being that leader

Crowdshape > Giving them the tools
