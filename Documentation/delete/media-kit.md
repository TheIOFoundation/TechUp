### The Problem

Governments across the globe implement numerous interventions in the form of policies, many of them directly affecting citizens’ Human and/or Digital Rights. Access to these policies is not always straightforward; estimating the global status of Rights even less so. Understanding which policies are implemented and their impact in people’s Rights is crucial not only for the citizens themselves but also for journalists and Rights advocates. Inspired by the need for transparency and accountability, Project Lockdown is committed to providing citizens of the world with the tools they need to stay safe and informed.

### Value Proposition

Project Lockdown adopts the following 2 core approaches to deliver its value proposition:

* Data collected strictly from official sources Project Lockdown identifies official source documents that are originated by governments with the objective of only delivering data that has legal merit.

Disclaimer: For a number of reasons, some of the current data on the COVID-19 NPIs dataset later was obtained from other sources. This situation is being resolved.

* Rights-based core data points All core data points are devised based on their potential impact on a clearly defined Human or Digital Right. This unique approach provides insight over the impact of government policies in citizens' Rights.
* Global Rights Index Combining official data and Rights-based data points enables Project Lockdown

Disclaimer: The Global Rights Index is a current Goal for Project Lockdown (and thus a Work In Progress)

### The Solution

Maintaining a neutral and unbiased stance, Project Lockdown provides a detailed account of policies implemented by governments across the globe organized in thematic dataset layers, which respond to relevant crises, critical policies or global trends.

The data, which is obtained through official government pronouncements, enables the monitoring of the state of Rights worldwide and is made available through a responsive web and mobile mapping interface and an open data API.

Project Lockdown takes a meticulous approach to collecting and synthesizing its data points in order to best serve users by encouraging a community approach that will champion transparency to maximize impact.

The ensemble of the data collected is the foundation of the Global Rights Index, a monitoring indicator that provides a quick understanding of the state of Rights worldwide.

#### Full version

The IO Foundation (TIOF) is a global for-impact NGO advocating for Data-Centric Digital Rights. Born from a fundamental concern about the state of Digital Rights in the world, its mission is to promote, _protect and provide solutions for Digital Rights_, thus aiming to bridge technological and humanitarian perspectives. As data becomes an increasingly powerful economic, political, and social force, _programmers are emerging as the next generation of Human and Digital Rights defenders_. There remains, however, a limited international understanding of the impact of technology on Human and Digital Rights. Following its vision of _a world where Human Rights and Digital Rights are one and the same_, TIOF aims to raise awareness of the importance of Digital Rights in collaboration with all stakeholders ranging from civil society, programmer communities, bodies of governance and corporate.
