TechUp offers free capacity-building sessions to anyone interested to learn new skills and support rights-based digital societies.

Focusing on civic tech, TechUp by The IO Foundation aims to build an empowered community spanning various sectors, from tech professionals and corporations to students and volunteers who we hope to serve as advocates of digital rights.

In one packed weekend, there is much to learn and take away from TechUpâ€™s monthly events.



Learn new tech capacities, interpersonal skills and discover fora where you can put your talent to social use.
