### About The IO Foundation <a href="#_fdklnwp3p5jx" id="_fdklnwp3p5jx"></a>

The IO Foundation (TIOF) is a global for-impact NGO advocating for Data-Centric Digital Rights. Born from a fundamental concern about the state of Digital Rights in the world, its mission is to promote, protect and provide solutions for Digital Rights, thus aiming to bridge technological and humanitarian perspectives. As data becomes an increasingly powerful economic, political, and social force, programmers are emerging as the next generation of Human and Digital Rights defenders. There remains, however, a limited international understanding of the impact of technology on Human and Digital Rights. Following its vision of a world where Human Rights and Digital Rights are one and the same, TIOF aims to raise awareness of the importance of Digital Rights in collaboration with all stakeholders ranging from civil society, programmer communities, bodies of governance and corporate.
