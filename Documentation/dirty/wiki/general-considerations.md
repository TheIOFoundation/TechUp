### NOTE: Welcome to the TechUp wiki! This section will be used for technical reference on TIOF's TechUp project and is currently a work in progress.

[TechUp](https://theiofoundation.org/TechUp) offers free capacity-building sessions to anyone interested to learn new skills and support rights-based digital societies.

Focusing on civic tech, TechUp by The IO Foundation aims to build an empowered community spanning various sectors, from tech professionals and corporations to students and volunteers who we hope to serve as advocates of digital rights.

In one packed weekend, there is much to learn and take away from TechUpâ€™s monthly events.

For anyone who signs up, TechUp presents opportunities for learning, growth and collaboration with professionals from around the world who are doing amazing work in their respective fields. Register for our monthly event [here](https://tiof.click/EventsRSVP).
