#### NOTE: Welcome to the TechUp wiki! This section will be used for technical reference on TIOF's TechUp project and is currently a work in progress.

### Proposing an Open Source Project

TechUp offers support to Open Source projects via a global network of programmers and technologists.

During the TechUp weekend, selected Open Source projects get 10 minutes to pitch to the community, after which they can spend the weekend running sprints with help from the community.

In order for an Open Source project to be featured in TechUp, the following criteria must be met;

* The project must be hosted on platform such as GutHub, GitLab etc
* There must be a publicly available Repository
* The project should have at least 10 stars on the Git platform

To propose an Open Source project, please reach out to us via this [form](https://tiof.click/TechUpForms), and we'll reach to make the necessary arrangements.
