The IO Foundation (TIOF) is organizing another TechUp Event on May 15-16, 2021.&#x20;

TechUp is a strategic project that centers on both tech capacity building and tech solution development. It advocates the production of new digital policies in government to promote and protect Digital Rights.

Along with its founding non-profit organization, it focuses on actualizing its advocacy, supporting and promoting open-source projects, and establishing networks among its stakeholders across the globe.&#x20;

We believe an individual’s participation is a milestone to attain our goal, but more so if it is a community. Therefore, as the community’s leader, we want to invite you and your community to this event. We look forward to raising awareness, establishing support, and building connections with you. Moreover, should you have any open-source projects, feel free to inform us and we will be glad to help you promote that project.&#x20;

Along with other stakeholders, we hope to see your community in this 48-hours event via Airmeet!

Together, let’s create a conducive environment for our Digital rights!
