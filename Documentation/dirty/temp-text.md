### Overview <a href="#_x7oejvklssa4" id="_x7oejvklssa4"></a>

Technology has undoubtedly become the catalyst for business strategy and transformation, and the lines between business and technology functions are blurring rapidly, leading many organizations to reevaluate the role of technology and in some cases redesign traditional operating models and organizational structures. The current pace, scale, and impact of technological innovation, disruption in Malaysia has also led to the exponential escalation of digital harms.

In an economy that's on its way to being totally driven by digital technology— from AI-powered search engines, social media, mobile devices, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, machine learning and the Internet of Things, no tech company can afford to be complacent.

Subject: Hi, next generation human rights defenders!

Body text:

Human rights defenders look slightly different today. They are no longer only characterized by activists who go down to the streets demanding better social, economic, and political policies . In the digital era, human rights are not only fought for online, they literally take on a digital form. Human rights protection in the digital space begins with protection of our digital entities, as our digital bodies _are_ us, that is why we need our technologists to build technologies that protect our human rights by design.

As front-liners of the digital space, technologists are humanity’s first line defense against the digital dark arts. The analogue space and the digital space are not divided, and the boundaries did not just blur during the last couple of years where the world has been dealing with a global public health crisis. The pandemic merely made it more visible. We know both the brilliance and the dangers of a life lived in the digital realm, that is how we know how digital policies shape our lives.

We need you and your input to create a better digital future for everyone, for you are the next generation human rights defender.

#### Notes (WiP) <a href="#_klfondfeijta" id="_klfondfeijta"></a>

**Convergence**: Huge amounts of data and applied intelligence can inform decisions that allow businesses to adapt and remain ahead of disruption. This also means that more personal data is at risk of being in the wrong hands.

**Data** **proliferation**: The fusion of physical and digital worlds has blurred industry boundaries, twisted value chains, and disrupted traditional value creation models—

**Speed** **&** **volatility**: Cloud computing and other technologies have lowered barriers to entry, allowing new business models to be developed and launched quickly and at scale—
