# \[TIOF TU] TechUp 2021 Intro Copy

**About Us**



For any society to be able to observe a proper implementation and respect of Digital Rights the following elements must converge:

* Citizens and CSOs need to be aware of their Digital Rights and have the necessary knowledge to observe and demand their enforcement.
* Bodies of governance must understand Digital Rights and observe the needs of their constituents in this subject.

TechUp is a TIOF project encompassing both Awareness and Engagement activities, that works towards enabling a conducive environment for Digital Rights, working with all sectors of society: from programmers to academia, corporate and bodies of governance.
