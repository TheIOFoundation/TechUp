# \[TIOF TU] TechUp 2021 Intro Copy

**About Us**

The IO Foundation \[TIOF] is an organization whose advocacy is data-centric Digital Rights; that is, Human Rights applied to digital domains. TIOF wishes to implement TechUp in its vision of human-driven technology that respects the Digital Rights of its citizens.

For any society to be able to observe a proper implementation and respect of Digital Rights the following elements must converge:

* Citizens and CSOs need to be aware of their Digital Rights and have the necessary knowledge to observe and demand their enforcement.
* Bodies of governance must understand Digital Rights and observe the needs of their constituents in this subject.

TechUp is a TIOF project encompassing both Awareness and Engagement activities, that works towards enabling a conducive environment for Digital Rights, working with all sectors of society: from programmers to academia, corporate and bodies of governance.

In short, TechUp is a convergence program between tech capacity building and tech solution development for NGOs aimed at nurturing a Social Tech society that will demand the observance, respect and enforcement of Digital Rights. TechUp aims to create a meaningful impact in society that will translate into new social policies in government.

**Objectives**

TechUp is designed with a specific set of objectives:

* To build tech capacities in citizens (with a strong focus on coders) and raise their awareness on Digital Rights.
* To encourage a collaborative ambiance between Tech groups to share their resources and knowledge.
* To provide effective tech solutions to NGOs.
* To foster community engagement via Tech volunteering.
* To create the necessary momentum for policy making on Digital Rights.
* To benefit Civil Society in their transition to an ever-growing interaction with digital domains.

**Stakeholders**

The TechUp project envisions bringing together the following actors:

TIOF: General coordinator of the program. Will strive to provide support and resources for the events and to the stakeholders.

Civic Tech: Providing tech knowledge via their members and external speakers to facilitate the workshops and participate in building solutions for NGOs.

Think+Do Tank: Designing the necessary indicators for policy making to be articulated along all the events so that they become actionable data for policy change proposals.

NGOs: Collaborating with the Tech Community to explore ways to improve their operations, implement the actions proposed and offer an inviting integration of tech volunteers among their organizations.

CSOs: These Organizations can be invited to actively participate in the workshops.
