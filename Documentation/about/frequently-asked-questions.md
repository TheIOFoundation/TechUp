### How do you make money?

Should we?

TechUp is an advocacy endeavor for The IO Foundation. We regard it as the way to encourage people to have a more proactive approach to sorting out the challenges of technology in digital societies.

While we actively seek for funding opportunities and always welcome donation support, we do not believe revenue should dictate whether TechUp exists or not.

In short, and in accordance to TIOF's Funding Policy, if we are doing our job well then you'll support us.
