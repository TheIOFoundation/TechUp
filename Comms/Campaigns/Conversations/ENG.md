### Introduction
Hi @XXX.
My name is Jean F. Queralt and I manage a tech NGO called The IO Foundation.

We run a monthly event called TechUp that would be relevant to the community.

Would it be OK to share about it?
If so, which channel would be the appropriate?

I'd also be interested in know more about your community and explore possible further support for it or collaborations.




### Follow up
Hi there.
Circling back on my previous message in case you had the chance to look into it.
